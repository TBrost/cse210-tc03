Hey, I'm Derek Jensen. I'm from Stockton, California though I currently live in Rexburg, ID. I am attending Brigham Young University (Idaho), and am majoring in computer science. 
I have a lot of hobbies. I enjoy climbing, hiking, board gaming, and roguelikes. I also like to read. I speak Spanish fluently after spending 14 months as a missionary in Peru.
I love life!
