# My name is Tyson Brost, I'm currently a sophmore at BYU-I seeking a major in Business analytics and a minor in Data science.
# I have a passion for statistics and work as a tutor for multiple math courses at BYU-I. Prior to this I worked many different
# types of construction/manual labor and owned and operated a small business selling shave ice. 
# When I'm not doing course work or tutoring I enjoy playing a variety of video games with my two younger brothers
